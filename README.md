# RISC-V-PIPELINE-ARCHITECTURE
This project implements a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor using System Verilog, covering all core pipeline stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory (MEM), and Write Back (WB). Each module is independently designed, connected, and tested to handle basic instruction types.
